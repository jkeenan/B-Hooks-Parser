19:10 < hobbs> *Please* don't trust me on this, but I think the while in S_scan_word could use isIDCONT_utf8 instead
19:12 < hobbs> because that's what that bit is, is looking for an identifier
19:13 < hobbs> so the starting condition maybe should be updated to isIDFIRST too :)



And what's up with this one?
